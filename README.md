# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze school standardized tests scores and funding in order to reveal insights. These insights are then used for strategic decisions by the school board regarding budget allocation. After I conducted an analysis using the data, the school board found evidence of academic dishonesty with Thomas High School's ninth grade math and reading scores. As a result of this, I removed those scores and redid the analysis.

## Results

A district summary of all of the schools' math and reading scores looks like this:
